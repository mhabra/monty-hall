# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

A simulation of the Monty Hall Problem in Python (and C++ because I got bored).

You can:
* simulate multiple trials
* choose whether to switch doors or not
* choose how many doors you want choose from (not just the standard 3)
* even choose how many doors you want to be a "winning door".

It's a good way to grasp the probabilistic nature of the problem.
